Documentation --> Creator Role List (current list)

// Map for the [list of words that describe role = key] --> [creator role = value] dictionary
// Creator role obtained only if a creator for the caption was found.
// The keys will be the different documentation types.
// The values will be their corresponding role.

//IGNORE LAST TWO LINES. (Apparently my original method of making the dictionaries is backwards...
//	...I look through lists of values to choose the appropriate key...
//	...Smaller dictionary sizes, but opposite flow than how it should be used...

"image creator" = "drawing", "photograph"
"map maker" = "map", "chart"


////"drawing" --> "image creator"
////"photograph" --> "image creator"

////"map" --> "map maker"
////"chart" --> "map maker"

//"plot" is a "map" or a "chart"?

// Special note: the documentation type of photograph is assumed unless one of the other documentation types is // evident from the caption text.
